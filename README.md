# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three matching symbols (X or O) on the board.


### Features
- Interactive console-based interface.
- Players can enter their moves by specifying the row and column numbers.
- The game checks for a winning condition after each move.
- It detects a draw if all spaces on the board are filled without a winner.


#### To play the Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Enter the row and column numbers as prompted to make your move.
5. The game will display the updated board and indicate the current player's turn.
6. Continue playing until there is a winner or a draw.
7. The game will announce the winner or a draw, and then it will exit.


##### This project relies on the standard C++ libraries and does not require any additional dependencies or external libraries.
